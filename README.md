# Stroke-Prediction
In this project, the scikit-learn library is used to train a stroke classifier model. The intention of the project is to practice data normalization, the use of classifiers, the construction of pipelines and the use of cross-validation.

### Dataset
The dataset used in this project was the Stroke Prediction Dataset available on  [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/fedesoriano/stroke-prediction-dataset/data). To run the project, download the dataset and place the csv file in the same directory as the `main.py` file.
